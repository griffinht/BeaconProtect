# BeaconProtect
Unique Minecraft plugin that uses beacons to prevent grief

This plugin allows players to form a group and claim beacons to protect their things. Protection only lasts inside the beacon range, which is affected by the tier of the beacon and can be extended by the plugin. 

Enemy players who enter protected areas must break blocks multiple times before the block drops. Defending players must keep chests (called beacon vaults) full of blocks they want to be protected. Blocks in these chests will be consumed as enemy players break the corresponding block. 

The plugin also allows for per block reinforcment, where a player can shift+click to reinforce a block. Reinforcing blocks takes blocks, and once reinforced will require multiple hits to break.

Commands:
/bp - admin commands
/group - group management
/groups - view world groups
